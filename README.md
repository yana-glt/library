# Online Library

## Description
This is an Online Library implemented in Node.js and TypeScript.

After registration, the user must sign in, after that he will get access to the Home page, where the latest book releases added to the library are presented.

The user will also get access to a page with a list of authors and a list of their books, and a list of genres, 
as well as the ability to search, edit, delete them and add new books (after adding new author and genre, if this data is not contained in the database yet). 

The application also offers the option of viewing reviews of a book and writing your own review.

The user can also use the Contact page to leave comments, remarks or suggestions.
